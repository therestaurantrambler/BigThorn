Big Thorn App
===================================

This app allows users to see a list of Big Thorn Farm and Brewery's current beers. It also allows the user to contact the owner via email, text or telephone call.

It was made after making the Just Java app from a Udacity course in the Beginning Android Nanodegree. 

Creation of an interactive app using object orientated principles: Variables, Methods, Data Types (String, Boolean, Integer), Hierarchy Diagrams, Nesting View Groups, Java Classes and Objects, Call Methods, Inheriting Behavior, Setting Data to Views, Conditional Codes, If/Else statements, Relational Operators, Intents
